# Obj-nameCapitalizer

This simple tool takes an objects containing `.txt` file (as an arg) and converts the `name` keys to be properly capitalized.

Outputs a new converted `.txt` file.

Built to be used with my [randsGenerator](https://github.com/sam-pop/randsGenerator) tool (but can be used without it with minor code tweaking).

## How to use

Run `node nameCapitalizer.js <input>` command to convert the input file.

...`node nameCapitalizer.js example.txt` will use the `example.txt` file and output a new `converted_example.txt` file.

## What i used

This simple tool was build using [node.JS](https://nodejs.org/).
